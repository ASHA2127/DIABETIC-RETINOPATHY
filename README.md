# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a Deep Learning-based web application that detects Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The system classifies images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy and helps in early detection of eye disease.
